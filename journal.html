          I began my first week of the CREU program by meeting with my PhD advisor Brittany English.  
          We discussed the current direction of this project based on work that we had done in previous semester's.  
          Currently, we have one modified car that so that it can be controlled using a joystick. In addition to the 
          the modifications that allow this control, we also added a system that will allow us to monitor the actions of the 
          child driving the vehicle.  The movements of the joystick are also saved to a text file.
        </p>
        <p class="lead" >
          However, there were some issues with the modidfication that were made.  Though the controls work, there are some inconsistencies 
          in the operation.  At times, the car does not respond as expected when the joystick is moved.  Also, there are issues with the 
          storage of the text files created while driving the car.  We would like to correct these issues before beginning work on the car 
          that will be controlled using the Microsoft Kinect.

          Week 2: September 5 - September 11

          My second week of CREU was focused on determining the issues with inconsistent control issues with the joystick controlled vehicle.  
          My first concern is cleaning up the wiring of the vehicle.  The final wiring of the vehicle was somewhat rushed due to deadlines.  
          Also, the use of an Arduino microcontroller increases the difficulty of clean wiring because it is not easily mounted to a breadboard 
          or perfboard. To improve upon this, I would like to build an Arduino directly onto a perfboard.  This will allow me to clean up wiring and solder it directly 
          to the perfboard.  I submitted an order list for parts this week to make sure that I can start this as soon as possible.  
        </p>
        <p class="lead" >
          While the parts are being ordered, I wanted to get a better understanding of the code used to record the driving of the car.  This code was created by a team member 
          that I worked with in the previous Fall and Spring semester.  This code is run on a Raspberry Pi 2.  I would like to get a better understanding of what was done so 
          that I can modify it to improve the data recorded into a text file.  Initially, we planned to do this using the Arduino microcontroller, but we do not have enough pins 
          on the device to allow this.  Instead I would like to send the data from the Arduino to the Raspberry Pi 2, then save it onto the hard drive where video recordings 
          will also be stored.  I have schedulued a meeting next week to get a better understanding of why things were done in the manner that they were.

          During my third week of CREU, I continued to look into fixing the exisiting data collection methods.  After meeting with Philip Wolfe, my previous team member who created the data collection system, we were unable to think of an effective way to send the text data to the Raspberry 
          Pi 2.  This is an issue because we are only able to transmit data using the I2C communication protocol.  To communicate in this manner, we need to make sure that only one thing is using this at a time in our system.  However, when the Raspberry Pi is attempteing to recieve the text from 
          the Arduino, the Arduino is also using I2C to read the time from a clock that we are using.  Because the Arduino's pins are mostly filled, we can not use another means of communication to send the text to the Raspberry Pi.
        </p>
        <p class="lead" >
          However, our system also allows a parent or caregiver to control the vehicle using a bluetooth application.  Currently, this application is only responsible for sending signals.  However, before this applicaiton was created, I utilized a Bluetooth Terminal application on android for texting.  This allowed me to send data to our system to move the car, and see text printed out by the Arduino.  Because of this, I believe that we would be able to read in the data via bluetooth, and save it to the phone or tablet of the caregiver or parent.  This would mitigate the hardware issues that we were having. I will look into this next week.

          I have began looking into updating the application that we have so that it can read data in and save it to a text file.  Firstly, I want to determine the best way to make the user aware of whether or not the data is being recorded.  I believe that beneath the buttons, that allow the user to control the car, I could put a green check, or a red x which states whether or not the vehicle is connected.  Once the vehicle is connected to the phone, it should automatically create a text file, and start recording.
        </p>
        <p class="lead" >
          I will begin looking into implementing this in code next week.
