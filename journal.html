          I began my first week of the CREU program by meeting with my PhD advisor Brittany English.  
          We discussed the current direction of this project based on work that we had done in previous semester's.  
          Currently, we have one modified car that so that it can be controlled using a joystick. In addition to the 
          the modifications that allow this control, we also added a system that will allow us to monitor the actions of the 
          child driving the vehicle.  The movements of the joystick are also saved to a text file.
        </p>
        <p class="lead" >
          However, there were some issues with the modidfication that were made.  Though the controls work, there are some inconsistencies 
          in the operation.  At times, the car does not respond as expected when the joystick is moved.  Also, there are issues with the 
          storage of the text files created while driving the car.  We would like to correct these issues before beginning work on the car 
          that will be controlled using the Microsoft Kinect.

        <h2>
          Week 1: September 5 - September 11
        </h2>
        <hr class="intro-divider">

          My second week of CREU was focused on determining the issues with inconsistent control issues with the joystick controlled vehicle.  
          My first concern is cleaning up the wiring of the vehicle.  The final wiring of the vehicle was somewhat rushed due to deadlines.  
          Also, the use of an Arduino microcontroller increases the difficulty of clean wiring because it is not easily mounted to a breadboard 
          or perfboard. To improve upon this, I would like to build an Arduino directly onto a perfboard.  This will allow me to clean up wiring and solder it directly 
          to the perfboard.  I submitted an order list for parts this week to make sure that I can start this as soon as possible.  
        </p>
        <p class="lead" >
          While the parts are being ordered, I wanted to get a better understanding of the code used to record the driving of the car.  This code was created by a team member 
          that I worked with in the previous Fall and Spring semester.  This code is run on a Raspberry Pi 2.  I would like to get a better understanding of what was done so 
          that I can modify it to improve the data recorded into a text file.  Initially, we planned to do this using the Arduino microcontroller, but we do not have enough pins 
          on the device to allow this.  Instead I would like to send the data from the Arduino to the Raspberry Pi 2, then save it onto the hard drive where video recordings 
          will also be stored.  I have schedulued a meeting next week to get a better understanding of why things were done in the manner that they were.
