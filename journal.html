          My first week of the DREU program started with a five hour drive from
          Augusta, GA.  After getting my keys and pulling everything out of my car,
          I got food and slept because I was too tired to do anything else. The
          next few days, I got the chance to the University of Florida to get
          acquanted with campus and the people I will be working with this summer.
          Both the campus and the people are really nice.
        </p>
        <p class="lead" >
          The project I am working on is called Brainwords.  The idea behind it
          is that we want to be able to determine if brainwaves can be used as a
          means to authenticate a user for a system.  This system could be anything
          from signing onto your computer, to a Google account.  If possible, we
          want to determine how effective it is, and observe the best way to implement it.
          This touches on information I have learn in an Introduction to Cybersecurity
          course I took last semester, so I'm glad to get started.
        </p>

        <p class="lead" >
          Finally, I wanted to see what Gainseville had to offer. First, I decided
          to just drive around the city without navigation to see what I would come
          across.  This turned up a couple sights that are shown in my pictures.
          Second, I got a list of places I should visit from one of my teammates,
          and started researching to see where I should go first.  I chose to go to
          Lake Wauberg where I got the chance to kyak for the first time.  I thought
          I would flip over, but a sign saying "DANGER ALLIGATORS" and eyes peeking
          out of the water motivated me to stay in my kayak.  In short, I enjoyed my first week.

        During my second week of the program I decided that I wanted to get as
        much experience working with BCI devices as I could.  With this in mind,
        I also started working with the Brain Drone Racing team.  This also gave
        me the chance to fly drones which was is a good plus.  So far, we have been
        able to fly the drone using a team member's EEG signals. Completing this
        has allowed us to identify areas in the existing system that can be improved upon.
        <ul>
          <li class="lead">Line Following: The DJI Phantom is supposed to use it's camera to
            follow a red line to keep it from veering during flight.
            This does not work well.</li>
          <li class="lead">Latency Issues: There has been some noteable lag between when a
            command is pressed and when the drone receives this command. </li>
          <li class="lead">Drone Choice: It may be useful to change the chosen drone.  The
            Parrot Bebop Drone has been tested and has the ability to hover much
            better than the DJI Phantom 3.</li>

        </ul>
      </p>
      <p class="lead" >
        In regards to the Brainwords project, we determined that the most effective
        way to proceed was to begin testing with team members to determine which
        EEG device should be used for further Testing purposes from the following devices.
        <ul>
          <li class="lead">EMOTIV Epoc: 16 Channel EEG Device</li>
            Notes: Large amount of channels provides potentially more accurate signals,
            but is more cumbersome to put on. Has provided API to process data.
          <li class="lead">EMOTIV Insight: 7 Channel EEG Device </li>
            Notes: Smaller amount of channels makes it easier to wear the headset,
            but may not provide an accurate amount of data. Has provided API to process data.
          <li class="lead">MUSE: 5 Channel EEG Device</li>
            Notes: Smallest amount of channels that is very comfortable to wear.  Smaller
            channels may not provide enough data for accurate identification.  Does not have
             existing API to process data.
        </ul>
      </p>

        On Thursday, I flew from Gainseville, FL to my second home formerly known as
        Atlanta, GA to attend the first National Society for Blacks in Computing conference.
        I was made aware of this conference by my faculty advisor Dr. Juan Gilbert.
        This conference was hosted at the Twelve Hotel in Atlantic Station.  From Thursday
        to Saturday evening, I had the opportunity to meet and hear from great people with
        the aim of improving the presence of blacks with PhDs in computing fields.  This conference
        included life coaching, interview preparation, tips on funding graduate school, and tips choosing
         the best graduate school for you. This program provided with a lot of information and a great network
          that will help me greatly in the future.

      During my third week of the research program, I got the chance to test two EEG devices with the team: the Emotiv Epoc and Emotiv Insight.
      In testing these devices, we wanted to see if we would be able to get noticeable similarities in EEG patterns when performing the task of
      counting down from 10 to 1 following a screen prompt.  These similarities were observed based on visual representations of EEG data shown
      in Emotiv's Test Bench.  This observation resulted in data that showed that data from the Epoc was unreliable.  this could be due to an
      inability to get a good amount of consistent connections with the channels of the Epoc.  This observation also provided us with the impression
      that the Insight will provide more accurate data.  This can be attributed to the increased level of ease to make connections with the channels
      on this device.  However, we have not been able to get all channels on the Insight to connect.  Also, while Ivens was able to get very similar
      waverforms while performing a task, I was not. More testing will allow us to determine if this happens consistently.
    </p>
    <p class="lead" >
      This week we also decided on four stimuli that we wanted to use that would allow the user to complete some thinking task and produce EEG signals.
      <ul>
        <li class="lead">Task 1: Listen to animals sounds, and determine which animals you hear.</li>
        <li class="lead">Task 2: Watch an image of a countdown, and count from 10 - 1.</li>
        <li class="lead">Task 3: Watch a video of Michael Jackson moonwalking, and count the number of steps. </li>
        <li class="lead">Task 4: Look at the image of the controversial black and blue dress, and think of what colors you see. </li>
      </ul>
      With these task we hoped that we would be able to provide consistent thought patterns within the user to allow them to be indentified.

      On Thursday, I drove back home to Augusta to check on my grandmother who had spent some time in the hospital before I started them REU program.
      I enjoyed the time I had to spend with family and see my grandmother get better.

    During my fourth week of the DREU program I got the chance to attempt the work with Muse.  The Muse is meant to connect to a computer or cell phone
    via bluetooth before signals can be transmitted.  I attempted to make this connection both with my laptp running Mac OSX and my Android phone
    running Marshmallow.  I was not able to get the Muse to pair properly with either of these devices.  Ivens also attempted to pair this device
    and was not successful.  He was able get the device to pair with a device running Linux.
  </p>
  <p class="lead" >
    This week I also got the chance to work with the Drone team.  This team has decided to split into two and work towards getting the Parrout Bebop 2
    drone to work with the Brain Drone Race Setup.  This would allow us to connect a laptop directly to the drone and fly it using key commands.  This
     is more effective than the DJI setup which currently requires signals to be sent to a webserver that then sends the signals down to an android device
     running an Android application.  This setup could provide a significant amount of latency issues.
  </p>

    On Tuesday, I got the chance to go out to eat at a pizza place called Satchel's which has a very interesting theme.
    There is even a van outside that you can sit in.  Everyone at the table got large Calzones which tasted great.  On Thursday, the University of Florida
    officially got the ability to have PhDs in Human Center Computing.
