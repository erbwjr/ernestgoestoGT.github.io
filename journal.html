          My first week of the DREU program started with a five hour drive from
          Augusta, GA.  After getting my keys and pulling everything out of my car,
          I got food and slept because I was too tired to do anything else. The
          next few days, I got the chance to the University of Florida to get
          acquanted with campus and the people I will be working with this summer.
          Both the campus and the people are really nice.
        </p>
        <p align="center">
          The project I am working on is called Brainwords.  The idea behind it
          is that we want to be able to determine if brainwaves can be used as a
          means to authenticate a user for a system.  This system could be anything
          from signing onto your computer, to a Google account.  If possible, we
          want to determine how effective it is, and observe the best way to implement it.
          This touches on information I have learn in an Introduction to Cybersecurity
          course I took last semester, so I'm glad to get started.
        </p>

          Finally, I wanted to see what Gainseville had to offer. First, I decided
          to just drive around the city without navigation to see what I would come
          across.  This turned up a couple sights that are shown in my pictures.
          Second, I got a list of places I should visit from one of my teammates,
          and started researching to see where I should go first.  I chose to go to
          Lake Wauberg where I got the chance to kyak for the first time.  I thought
          I would flip over, but a sign saying "DANGER ALLIGATORS" and eyes peeking
          out of the water motivated me to stay in my kayak.  In short, I enjoyed my first week.

        During my second week of the program I decided that I wanted to get as
        much experience working with BCI devices as I could.  With this in mind,
        I also started working with the Brain Drone Racing team.  This also gave
        me the chance to fly drones which was is a good plus.  So far, we have been
        able to fly the drone using a team member's EEG signals. Completing this
        has allowed us to identify areas in the existing system that can be improved upon.
        <ul>
          <li>Line Following: The DJI Phantom is supposed to use it's camera to
            follow a red line to keep it from veering during flight.
            This does not work well.</li>
          <li>Latency Issues: There has been some noteable lag between when a
            command is pressed and when the drone receives this command. </li>
          <li>Drone Choice: It may be useful to change the chosen drone.  The
            Parrot Bebop Drone has been tested and has the ability to hover much
            better than the DJI Phantom 3.</li>

        </ul>
      </p>
      <p align="center">
        In regards to the Brainwords project, we determined that the most effective
        way to proceed was to begin testing with team members to determine which
        EEG device should be used for further Testing purposes from the following devices.
        <ul>
          <li>EMOTIV Epoc: 16 Channel EEG Device</li>
            Notes: Large amount of channels provides potentially more accurate signals,
            but is more cumbersome to put on. Has provided API to process data.
          <li>EMOTIV Insight: 7 Channel EEG Device </li>
            Notes: Smaller amount of channels makes it easier to wear the headset,
            but may not provide an accurate amount of data. Has provided API to process data.
          <li>MUSE: 5 Channel EEG Device</li>
            Notes: Smallest amount of channels that is very comfortable to wear.  Smaller
            channels may not provide enough data for accurate identification.  Does not have
             existing API to process data.
        </ul>
      </p>

        On Thursday, I flew from Gainseville, FL to my second home formerly known as
        Atlanta, GA to attend the first National Society for Blacks in Computing conference.
        I was made aware of this conference by my faculty advisor Dr. Juan Gilbert.
        This conference was hosted at the Twelve Hotel in Atlantic Station.  From Thursday
        to Saturday evening, I had the opportunity to meet and hear from great people with
        the aim of improving the presence of blacks with PhDs in computing fields.  This conference
        included life coaching, interview preparation, tips on funding graduate school, and tips choosing
         the best graduate school for you. This program provided with a lot of information and a great network
          that will help me greatly in the future.
